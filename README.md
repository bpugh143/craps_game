# Intro to Ruby and Programming

## Project

Build a simple craps game

## Requirements

Create classes for common objects in a craps game.  When you run the game the program will ask for a number of players (limited to 5) and request each player's name. 

## Rules

Dice will roll a random value between 2 and 12. If the Come Out roll results in a 7 or 11, the player has rolled a Natural and is declared the winner. If the Come Out roll results in a 2, 3, or 12, the player has rolled a Crap Out and has lost. Any other Come Out roll will estalish a point that must be duplicated before rolling a 7 (Ex: A player rolls a 6. That player must roll another 6 before a 7 is rolled). If the point is duplicated, the player is declared the winner. If a 7 is rolled before the point is duplicated, the player has rolled a Seven-out and has lost.

## NOTE

The origional tutorial for this game was forked from Chris Haupt's card-game repo on github. You can find it at https://github.com/sacruby/card-game. I used the repo as a model to build this game. Enjoy!
