# Intro to Ruby and Programming

## Project

Build a simple craps game

## Requirements

Create classes for common objects in a craps game. Include Dice, Turn, Player, and a GameEngine. When you run the game
the program will ask for a number of players (limited to 5) and request each player's name. It will then create a deck of standard
52 cards, arranged by rank and suit. The suits are Clubs Diamonds Hearts Spades (lowest to highest value) and the ranks
are 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King Ace (lowest to highest).

Shuffle the deck, deal each player one card, and then compare the cards. The player with the highest card wins!

## Extra Credit

* Add support for player's to have more than one card

## NOTE

The origional tutorial for this game was forked from Chris Haupt's card-game repo on github. You can find it at https://github.com/sacruby/card-game. I used the repo as a model to build this game. Enjoy!
